    "Outside of the material taught in class, for my project I learned how to use the basics of the pandas dataframe and webbrowser module. I choose to use the pandas dataframe since it made the layout look a bit nicer, and I like the funcionality of the webbrowser module. I tried using more pandas specific things, such as the .drop() function, but they did not work the way I wanted them to so I had to opt for other options. These new concepts took a bit of trial and error since most of the methods I found online produced an error."
